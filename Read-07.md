## What is a JavaScript function?
A function is a block of code that is used to complete tasks. It requires users to give it information to process and can be used many times. You can tailor functions to operate how you like.
You can call them what you want too. Outcomes can be used again in other functions.

## What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?
To call a function is to ask it to run the code block.

For example:

function myFunction(){
    xyz = xyz
}

To call the function, you state:

myFunction();
