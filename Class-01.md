## Class 01 - Growth Mindset

A ***growth mindset*** believe's that our fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort. Regardless of existing intelligence and talent. 

A growth mindset is in contrast to a ***fixed mindset*** where talent and intelligence is seen as fixed and that success comes from both of these - rather than through development and effort.

A ***growth mindset*** can be helpful when faced with the following, in both work and life:
- Tackling Challenges
- Overcoming Obstacles
- Giving Maximum Effort
- Facing Criticism

Three important reminders to myself to keep a growth mindset:
1. How would tomorrow me feel knowing what I am doing now?
1. Others achievments are a source of motivation, not hinderance.
2. Failure shouldn't be feared, but encouraged.
