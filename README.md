## Class 01 - Growth Mindset

A ***growth mindset*** believe's that our fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort. Regardless of existing intelligence and talent. 

A growth mindset is in contrast to a ***fixed mindset*** where talent and intelligence is seen as fixed and that success comes from both of these - rather than through development and effort.
