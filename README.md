## About Me:
My name is Max, I am 24 years old. I have a background working for the Civil Service. I am now going through a career change and I am pursuing a career in Web Development. I have been teaching myself all things HTML and CSS for the last 6 months, and I am now embarking on the Tech Educators Full-stack skills bootcamp course. My end goal of the course is to secure an entry-level developer role where I can continue to learn and develop my career and self.
