My name is Max Pollock, I am 24 years old. I have a background working for the Civil Service. I am now going through a career change and I am pursuing a career in Web Development. I have been teaching myself all things HTML and CSS for the last 6 months, and I am now embarking on the Tech Educators Full-stack skills bootcamp course.
