# Read-08: Operators and Expressions

## What is an expression in JavaScript?
A valid unit of code.

An example of an expression is:

a = 3

as well as,

b = 1 + 2

Whilst they both equal 3. They are both slightly different, where one uses the operator '+' and the other is a straight expression.

However, all expressions due use one symbol. At least a =.

## When does a for loop stop executing?
