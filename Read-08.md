# Read-08: Operators and Expressions

## What is an expression in JavaScript?

A valid unit of code.

An example of an expression is:

a = 3

as well as,

b = 1 + 2

Whilst they both equal 3. They are both slightly different, where one uses the operator '+' and the other is a straight expression.

However, all expressions due use one symbol. At least a =.

## Why would we use a loop in our code?

This allows us to repeat code without writing it out multiple times.
Using a loop, you can create 1000's of outcomes, but with 1 line, not 1000's.

## When does a for loop stop executing?

A for loop stops executing once the condition in the function has been met.

For example, if your condition is that i < 8, once your loop has ran enough times that i is greater than 8, it wil no longer run.

## How many times will a while loop execute?

A while loop will continue as long as the condition in the 'while' is still being met. If the original condition described is met straight away, then the while loop will not start.
