# Read-05: Design Web Pages with CSS

## What is the purpose of CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) lets you make your webpage look nice and most importantly, functional. CSS allows you manipulate the way your webpage looks, after you have created a structure with HTML.

Although HTML is the structure of the page, CSS dictates how it looks on your webpage across multiple devices and screens.

CSS opens up for never ending possibilities of sizing, colors, animations and responsive design.

## What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

You can insert your CSS in 3 different ways:
1. External CSS
1. Internal CSS
1. Inline Css

**External CSS** is when you use CSS rules from one other file that is linked to your HTML page through the <head> and <link>.

**Internal CSS** is when one HTML page has a style only used for that page. This coded directly onto the HTML document within the <head>.

**Inline CSS** is similar to Internal CSS but rather than coded directly into the <head> it is put directly into the element you want to style.

## Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text.

p {
    color: red;
}
