# **Read 01 - Markdown Notes**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used for a variety of reasons. It differs to word/text editing software where you have to click for formatting options. Instead, Markdown uses * and ***hashtags*** to create differing format options.

Markdown can be used for lots of things. For example:
- Websites
- Documents
- Notes
- Books
- Presentations
- Emails
- Instructions

## Markdown has lots of functions and options to create clear and concise instructions. This includes:

### Creating links:
[ Link Name Here ] ( LINK URL OR RELATIVE PATH ) **with no spaces between**

### Create Headings:
To create a heading, you put the following symbol before the heading #
To create the largest heading you would use #
Then you would add one more for the next size down, for example: ##

### Using Bold and Italics
To make something bold, you would need ** ** around the text
For Italics, you would put * * around the text
For both, you would use *** ***

### Create Lists
You can make an unordered list by using either of the following - * or +.
