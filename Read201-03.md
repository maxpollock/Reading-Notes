# Learn HTML

## When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

You should use <ul> when you want to create a list of items. For example, a Nav uses a ul to list the points on a navigation bar.

## How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

You can access this like the below:

ul {
list-style-type: circle;
}

## When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

ul should be used as above but an ol should be used when you want to have a numbered list of items. Such as a method for cooking or a list of top ten things.

## Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

You can use the 'start=\*' attribute. For example:

<!-- <ol start="50">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol> -->

This will start at 50.

OR

By using 'counter-reset'.
