# Learn HTML

## When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

You should use <ul> when you want to create a list of items. For example, a Nav uses a ul to list the points on a navigation bar.

## How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

You can access this like the below:

ul {
list-style-type: circle;
}

## When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

ul should be used as above but an ol should be used when you want to have a numbered list of items. Such as a method for cooking or a list of top ten things.

## Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

You can use the 'start=\*' attribute. For example:

<!-- <ol start="50">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol> -->

This will start at 50.

OR

By using 'counter-reset'.

# Learn CSS

## List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

1. Margin
1. Padding
1. Border
1. Content

# Learn JS

## What data types can you store inside of an Array?

You can store all data-types in an array.

## Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

People array is a valid array. It has multiple [] within the [] but is still valid.

You would use the following:

arrayName[rowIndex][columnIndex]

## List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

1. += - Add 1
1. -= - Subtract 1
1. \*= - Multiply itself
1. /= - Divide itself
1. === - strictly equal to

## Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

  The output of the below code, after evaluating the last statement, would result in an error.

  The last expression is asking you to add together a string and a number, then add that to a falsy statement; which is not possible.

## Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
   
   A good example of this could be balance in a PayPal account. If the user has enough money on their PayPal, they can process the transaction and buy the item. 
   E.g. PayPal >= TransactionAmount

## Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.

  Loops are useful when you need to repeat a process to check whether a condition is met, based on user input or not.

  For example, if you needed to check if a user had correctly inputted a value you have in an array. You can set a loop to constantly check if the user input has a matching index.
