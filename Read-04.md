# Read-04 Structure Web Pages with HTML

## What is HTML and why do we use it?

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a language used in Web Development to help create structure in a web-page. This is the building blocks of the website where you dictate what goes where.

HTML uses semantic and non-semantic elements.

HTML uses opening and closing tags (in most cases) and in-cases the content you want to include on your webpage.

HTML can facilitate things like images, gifs, videos, forms and tables.

## What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

1. Opening Tag
1. Content
1. Closing Tag

## What is it called when you give an element extra information?

An Attribute contains extra information that you don't want to include in the actual content that is displayed. For example, "class".

## What is a semantic element?

A semantic element includes <article> or <main>. These are structuring elements that we use to denote where things go for better organisation of our webpages.
